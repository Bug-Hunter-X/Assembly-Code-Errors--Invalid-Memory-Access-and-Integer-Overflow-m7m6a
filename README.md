# Assembly Code Bug: Memory Access and Overflow

This repository demonstrates a common bug in assembly code: accessing memory outside the allocated stack space and potential integer overflow.  The original code (`bug.asm`) contains these issues, leading to undefined behavior.  The solution (`bugSolution.asm`) addresses these errors using appropriate checks and handling mechanisms.
