mov eax, [ebp+8] ; This line assumes that the address pointed to by ebp+8 contains a valid integer.  If this address is invalid (e.g., outside the allocated stack space), a segmentation fault will occur.
mov ebx, [ebp+12] ; Similarly, this line assumes a valid integer at ebp+12.
add eax, ebx ; Add the two integers together. This could lead to an integer overflow if the sum exceeds the maximum value for a 32-bit integer.
mov [ebp-4], eax ; Store the result in a local variable.  Again, ensure there is enough space allocated on the stack.
